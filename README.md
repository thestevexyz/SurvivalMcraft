Official plugin of the SurvivalMcraft Server

This plugin was made for a private project called SurvivalMcraft.
Because it is only made for this specific project, I have not added any configuration options, so you would have to modify and then build the plugin by yourself.
Maybe a configuration file will be added later if publicly demanded.

## Features
  - Home system (only one home per player (additional homes might be added later))
  - Spawn command
  - Ping command

The home and spawn command have a beautiful animation with a teleportation delay of five seconds, that can be cancelled if the player moves.

## Support
If you do have questions or feedback regarding this plugin, or to any other content I know of, please feel free to contact me on my Discord Server: https://go.thesteve.xyz/discord
