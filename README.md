# SurvivalMcraft
Official plugin of the SurvivalMcraft Server

This plugin was made for a Minecraft Project called SurvivalMcraft.
I uploaded the plugin to GitHub so you can hopefully learn from it.
It does not have any configuration file for customization, however if requested, I can also add a config file of course.

## Current Features:
- Home system (only one home)
- Spawn command
- Broadcast player's death location to everyone on the server

The home and spawn commands do have a nice animation with a five seconds cooldown that is cancelled once the player moves.

## Support
